Quizzical Empire Online
====

_Quizzical Empire Online_ is an evolving authoring system for the trivia quizzes
presented by Molly Newman. See the
[Quizzical Empire website](http://quizzicalempire.com/) for details about participating in the live quiz. 

The application is currently deployed as
[http://quizzical.herokuapp.com/](http://quizzical.herokuapp.com/)

The first phase will support creating quizzes and presenting them (which
includes tracking scores for teams).  A later phase will support a way for
players to partcipate in the quiz using an HTML5 app on their smart phone,
rather than pencil and paper.

This is a prototype, a way to learn a stack that includes:

* Bootstrap
* Mustache
* jQuery
* Node.js
* CoffeeScript
* MongoDB
